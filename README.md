# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the Land of Laziness 🛌💤

I'm **MrTimonM**, a *master* of procrastination 😴 and automation enthusiast! I love playing with APIs, automating all the boring stuff, and generally doing anything to avoid real work. 🤖💻

## What You'll Find Here:
- Apps that do stuff... so I don’t have to 🛠️✨
- API experiments (aka hacking) 🔧
- Cool projects I'll totally finish... *someday* 🗓️

## My Superpowers:
- **Automating the mundane** – Why do something twice? Let the machines handle it! 🤖
- **API Hacking** – I dig deep into APIs, mostly to see what buttons I can push 🔍
- **Expert Procrastinator** – I always deliver... eventually 😎

## Current Status:
- 🛌 Thinking about starting that new project... maybe after a nap.
- ☕ Powered by caffeine and the promise of *"I'll do it tomorrow."*

## Fun Fact:
If laziness was an Olympic sport, I'd have won gold... but I was too lazy to show up! 🏅

🌱 I’m currently "working" on: **Getting motivated.**

💬 Ask me about: **Automation, APIs, or how to do nothing productively.**

📫 How to reach me: Just send a message... but expect a delay. 😉
