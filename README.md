# Welcome to My GitHub! 🛌💤

I'm **MrTimonM**, a *professional procrastinator* 🥇 and part-time coder (when I feel like it). I'm all about automating my life so I can sit back and do... nothing! 😎

## What’s Cookin’ Here:
- Automation apps that make my life easier (because effort is overrated) 🤖🍕
- Projects I’ll probably finish... eventually 🗓️
- A bunch of cool stuff you’ll never see because it’s all still in my head! 🤯

## My Powers:
- **Automating Laziness**: Why do it when a script can do it for you? 🚀
- **Creative Excuses**: I'll get to it... tomorrow. Probably. Maybe. 😜

## Current Status:
- 🛌 Procrastinating with style.
- ☕ Running on caffeine and 3 hours of sleep.
- 📚 Currently learning: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** 🎨💻
- 🧠 **Wishing** to learn: **Pyrogram** (once I stop procrastinating...) 🤞🐍

💬 Reach out, but don’t expect a speedy reply... I'm probably napping. 😉
